# SimpleChat

SimpleChat is a project written in Java, it contains both server and client. Project was made for the sole purpose of practicing server-client (socket) java programming.
This project can be used as a template for most client-server applications !

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
In the NetBeansProjects folder you can have access to source code, meanwhile ChatServer and ChatClient are pre compiled .jar files with corresponding batch scripts to run theme on Windows.
Server is optimised for running as a systemd service on Ubuntu, and in order to run it you will need sudo privilege on your user.

IMPORTANT: Comments in source code are in Serbian (Latin), that is my native langauage. You can translate theme via google. All the interfaces are in English.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this software you need to have Java installed, although its recommended to use Java 8 you can use any version.
